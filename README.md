# WinSerKicker
Kick user from terminal server with username

## Why?
Because with a lot of terminal user, the Task Manager becomes very slow and unusable. I/We don't have time for microshit things.

## Usage
- Run ```kicker.ps1``` or ```kicker.bat``` (the batch just calls the Power's Hell script, but easier to execute...)
- Give admin privileges to the script (if not started as admin) 
- Type in the desired username
- GG
