# WinSerKicker
Kick user from terminal server with username

## Why?
Because with a lot of terminal user, the Task Manager becomes very slow and unusable. I/We don't have time for microshit things.

## Usage
- Kick users from the current server by username
- Get hostname for username on the current server
